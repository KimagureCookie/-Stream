### WIP (I'm working on the software side of things right now!)

A few weeks ago, I wanted to buy a hot air station for some smd rework. While I was searchig for one, I came across a lot of chinese hot air stations which seem to be dirt cheap and also resonably reliable. Howerver the problem is that, these seem to be outdated design and somewhat lack in saftey!
On the other hand the offerings from top players like JBC and Wellers seems to be out of reach for any hobbyist.

I guess these are enough excuses for making my own hot air station. Since I can't make the core components (The Heater and air pump units) I will be working on the controller unit. The heater and pumps can be purchased easily through any online repair parts sellers or even better if you could directly buy from chinese sites like aliexpress. 

I will try to add everything I have cooked so far in the coming days.

Edit: As of now everthing on hardware is tested and corrected in schematics/PCB. The idea of implementing the thermocouple amplifier using an precision op-amp has to be scractched since, I can't figure out the problem with my current setup (glad I implemented the MAX6675 as a backup!).
Although I have run basic software tests, there is still more code to test thoroughly.
